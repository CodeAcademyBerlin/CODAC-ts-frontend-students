Hello students!

### Office hours & access

👩‍💻 The official office hours for our campus at Erich-Weinert Str. 145 is open Monday to Friday from 09:30am to 05:30pm. 👨‍💻

With the [bold smartlock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sesam.technology.bold&gl=US&pli=1) you can access the main door from 7am and you are welcome to stay longer, as long as there is still a staff member in the office.

Please talk to your mentors or any staff member to activate your account on the app.

Please note, that you can NOT access the office on weekends plus the main entrance to the building automatically locks at 8 pm.

### Attendance

We are obliged to track your attendance during the stand-up meeting and send it in monthly reports to your agent.

To be reported as an excused day, the Jobcenter / Agentur für Arbeit only allows the following reasons as legit:

Be aware, reasons like waiting for a delivery, craftmen appointments or waiting in line at the apple store for the new iphone are not considered important reasons.

When you are with the Jobcenter / Agentur für Arbeit, you have the right to apply for 2 days of vacation per month. Every request for holidays must be approved by your agent.

Finally, please be aware, that unexcused missing days might apply some more serious consequences. According to the guidelines of Agentur für Arbeit:

- after 21 consecutive sick days,
- attendance drop to under 75%,

You will receive an automated email as a reminder for each uexcused missing day.

To sum it up, please always try to be on time for your stand-up and talk to the staff for any case you can not join onsite.
