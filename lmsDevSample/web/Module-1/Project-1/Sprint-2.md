## Epic 1: Flexbox

### Start by playing the froggy game

You can find it here: [https://flexboxfroggy.com/](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

### Style your Registration page using the power of Flexbox

Flexbox is a CSS tool used to position elements in a box. Think of your registration page as a box containing the form. The form itself is a box, and within it, you can create other boxes (div) to position your elements in the same row or column. Our advice is to take a piece of paper and draw the position you want all your inputs to have. Afterward, try to group them in a meaningful way (by column or by row).

Now it's time to go back to your computer and try to achieve this result!

## Epic 2: CSS Grid

### Play the garden grid game

You can find it here: [https://cssgridgarden.com/](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

### Apply CSS Grid to one of your pages

Now it's time to use CSS Grid to position the elements of one of your pages

**Tip**: don't change the HTML file directly, create a copy and work on the copy first. Once you achieved what you want using CSS Grid, change the link in the navigation bar to point to the page where you applied the grid.

Once you are done you can add new pages to your beautiful website.

**Remember to think in small steps, you don't want to break your code the day before the deadline**  
**Remember to validate all your pages**

## Epic 3: Presentation, code review, and code refactor

### Refactor your code

After the presentation and the code review from your mentors, take the rest of the day to refactor your code. This is one of the most important phases of learning how to code because is when most of the missing pieces come together into a defined picture.

### Git and GitHub

Tomorrow you will be introduced to Git and GitHub. Take some time today to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer, we will not have time tomorrow.
