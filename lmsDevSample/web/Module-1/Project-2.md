Welcome to Project 2 which focuses on learning JavaScript and how it can be used together with HTML and CSS to create dynamic websites.

Last week you had the chance to see how through DOM manipulation we can change, remove, add HTML elements or CSS properties to our pages. At the end of this project, you will be able to do the same!

Here you can find a valuable resource website for JavaScript: [(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

Please save it in your favorites so you will have easy access.

## Project Overview

During the first Sprint, you will have only small tasks. You will be assigned basic exercises that will train your problem-solving skills.

In the second Sprint, you will create another website of your choice and you will have to pull live data from free APIs and display them.

During the third Sprint, you will have to add some filtering system to your website to make it dynamic.

In the fourth Sprint, you will make your website responsive to mobile devices.

Excited? Let's start then!

**Completion Time**: 4 weeks
