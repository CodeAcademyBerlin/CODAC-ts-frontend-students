Welcome to Project 1 which focuses on learning two of the most important languages used to create modern websites: HTML and CSS.

In this project, you will have the chance to design a website about what you like, following the mentors' guidelines about the features you should have in it.
You can have a look at an example of how it could be here: [https://northyouthsoccerleaguewebsite.netlify.app/index.html](https://northyouthsoccerleaguewebsite.netlify.app/index.html)

As you know, it is very important to learn 'how to google'. As we all know, we can not improve if we can not measure. Therefore, you can consider the amount of time to find a solution on google as the right parameter for measurement. So, as you grow, you should improve.

Since you are a beginner and don't have the knowledge of keywords that will lead you to the right solution, our advidce is to first google in English and then write the specific technology (in this case HTML or CSS) you want to know the answer for. It works in most cases and you will see that after a while you will be able to get to the right source faster.
Here you can find a valuable resource website for HTML and CSS: [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/).

Please save it in your favorites so you will have easy access.

Learning how to read the documentation is also a very important skill you will learn. Therefore we encourage you to first try to understand how to implement a specific feature by yourself and then ask your mentors for help.

As you book Calendly with your mentors, you are supposed to mention the topic of discussion in a detailed manner. Many times it has been found, once you know your problem, you know your solution too. At the same time, your mentor will ask you what are the things that you have tried before asking for help, therefore it is advised to come prepared for the meeting.

## Project Overview

In this project, first, you will go through the basic concepts of HTML and CSS and then you will have a day to create a simple design for a website of your choice. Afterward, you will gradually be introduced by your mentors to different technologies that you will be asked to include in your pages. At the end of the project, you will present the website and the code in front of your mentors and colleagues for what is called a code review. This part is very important in a developer's job because it's when you get feedback and at the same time you can see how others solved the same problem in their way. The following day will be used to refactor your code and push it live on the world wide web!
